I am a creative, committed front end developer based in Manchester. Having fulfilled my academic goals and worked in a diverse range of jobs, coding appealed to my creativity and eagerness to learn. I applied to study at the Makers Academy bootcamp, and spent twelve intense weeks pushing myself to produce clear, readable code. Since then I've worked for a variety of tech companies, from consultancy to startup. I care deeply about making things- whether it's code or artwork or just a cup of coffee, and I am looking to progress my career as a front end developer.
