I am a creative, committed postgraduate based in London. Having fulfilled my academic goals, coding deeply appealed to my creativity and eagerness to learn. I care deeply about making things- from programs and artwork all the way to coffee. I am looking to embark upon a career in the London tech industry as a junior developer.

## Skills

#### Creativity

- I am an experienced user of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign thanks to my background in art and design.
