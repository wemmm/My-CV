I am a creative, committed postgraduate based in London. Having fulfilled my academic goals, coding appealed to my creativity and eagerness to learn. I care deeply about making things- from programs and artwork all the way to coffee. I am looking to embark upon a career in the London tech industry as a junior developer, and to continue along the path of software craftsmanship!
